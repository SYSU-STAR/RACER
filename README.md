# RACER

**RACER**, a **RA**pid **C**ollaborative **E**xplo**R**ation approach using a
fleet of decentralized UAVs. 

We develop a fully decentralized approach for exploration tasks using a fleet of quadrotors. The proposed system features robustness against unstable communication and a high degree of coordination. The quadrotor team operates with asynchronous and limited communication and does not require any central control. The coverage paths and workload allocations of the team are optimized and balanced in order to fully realize the system's potential. The associated paper has been published in IEEE Transactions on Robotics and is selected as the **2023 IEEE TRO Best Paper**!

## Quick Start

This project has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04(ROS Melodic) and 20.04(ROS Noetic).

Firstly, you should install __nlopt v2.7.1__:
```
git clone -b v2.7.1 https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt.git
cd nlopt
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

Next, you can run the following commands to install other required tools:
```
sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev
```

After that, you need to install __LKH-3__(LKH-3.0.6 version is recommended) with the following commands. Please make sure the executable file `LKH` is correctly placed at `/usr/local/bin`.

```
wget http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH-3/LKH-3.0.6.tgz
tar xvfz LKH-3.0.6.tgz
cd LKH-3.0.6
make
sudo cp LKH /usr/local/bin
```
<!-- To simulate the depth camera, we use a simulator based on CUDA Toolkit. Please install it first following the [instruction of CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/zh-cn/cuda-toolkit). 

After successful installation, in the **local_sensing** package in **uav_simulator**, remember to change the 'arch' and 'code' flags in CMakelist.txt according to your graphics card devices. You can check the right code [here](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/wiki/Compatibility). For example:

```
  set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS 
    -gencode arch=compute_61,code=sm_61;
  ) 
``` -->

Then simply clone and compile our package (using ssh here):

```
cd ${YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH}/src
git clone https://github.com/SYSU-STAR/RACER.git
cd ../ 
catkin_make
```

After compilation you can start a sample swarm exploration demo. Firstly run ```Rviz``` for visualization: 

```
source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch exploration_manager rviz.launch
```
then run the simulation (run in a new terminals): 
```
source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch exploration_manager swarm_exploration.launch
```

By default you can see a pillar-like environment. Trigger the quadrotor to start exploration by the ```2D Nav Goal``` tool in ```Rviz```. A sample is shown below, where unexplored structures are shown in grey and explored ones are shown in colorful voxels. The FoV and trajectories of the quadrotor are also displayed.

<!-- You will find a cluttered scene to be explored (20m x 12m x 2m) and the drone . You can trigger the exploration to start by  A sample simulation is shown in the figure. The unknown obstacles are shown in grey, while the frontiers are shown as colorful voxels. The planned and executed trajectories are also displayed. -->

## Exploring Different Environments

The exploration environments in our simulator are represented by [.pcd files](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.html).
We provide several sample environments, which can be selected in [swarm_exploration.launch](swarm_exploration/exploration_manager/launch/swarm_exploration.launch):

```xml
  <!-- Change office.pcd to specify the exploration environment -->
  <!-- We provide office.pcd, office2.pcd, office3.pcd and pillar.pcd in this repo -->
  <node pkg ="map_generator" name ="map_pub" type ="map_pub" output = "screen" args="$(find map_generator)/resource/pillar.pcd"/>    
```

Other examples can be found in [map_generator/resource](uav_simulator/map_generator/resource). If you want to use your own environments, simply place the .pcd files in [map_generator/resource](uav_simulator/map_generator/resource), and follow the comments above to specify it. You may also need to change the bounding box of explored space in [exploration.launch](swarm_exploration/exploration_manager/launch/single_drone_planner.xml):
```xml
  <arg name="box_min_x" value="-10.0"/>
  <arg name="box_min_y" value="-15.0"/>
  <arg name="box_min_z" value=" 0.0"/>
  <arg name="box_max_x" value="10.0"/>
  <arg name="box_max_y" value="15.0"/>
  <arg name="box_max_z" value=" 2.0"/>
```
and the map_floor parameters in the map_publisher node in [swarm_exploration.launch](swarm_exploration/exploration_manager/launch/swarm_exploration.launch) or the exploration launch file that is going to be used to match the size of the map:
```xml
    <param name="map_floor/x_min" value="-7.5" type="double"/>
    <param name="map_floor/x_max" value="7.5" type="double"/>
    <param name="map_floor/y_min" value="-15.0" type="double"/>
    <param name="map_floor/y_max" value="15.0" type="double"/>
```

To create your own .pcd environments, you can use [this tool](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FUEL#creating-a-pcd-environment). 

<!-- ## Creating a _.pcd_ Environment

We provide a simple tool to create .pcd environments.
First, run:

```
  rosrun map_generator click_map
```

Then in ```Rviz```, use the ```2D Nav Goal``` tool (shortcut G) to create your map. Two consecutively clicked points form a wall.
An example is illustrated:-->

<p id="demo5" align="center">
<img src="files/create_map.gif" width = "600" height = "340"/>
</p>

<!-- After you've finished, run the following node to save the map in another terminal:

```
  rosrun map_generator map_recorder ~/
```

Normally, a file named __tmp.pcd__ will be saved at ```~/```. You may replace ```~/``` with any locations you want.
Lastly, you can use this file for exploration, as mentioned [here](#exploring-different-environments). -->
